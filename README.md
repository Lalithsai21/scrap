# Scrape and Summarize using OpenAI
This is a simple example of a Python app that takes a URL and either just scrapes and prints on the webpage or if you add your OpenAI Key, it will scrape the URL and summarize the webpage for you.
The app does not store any of the scraped sites or the keys anywhere. You can feel free to browse the full code here.
